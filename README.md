MATLAB codes for the paper "SOME NEW CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS OF POD-GREEDY ALGORITHMS" by Yuwen Li and Yupeng Wang.

PODGreedy.m outputs errors of the Weak POD-Greedy method with m = 1 for a parabolic problem and plots curves of the error estimator \Delta_n and error e_n in Fig. 5.1.1 (left);

PODGreedymbasis.m outputs errors of the Weak POD-Greedy method with m = 1,...,4 for the parabolic problem and plots curves of errors E_N for in Fig. 5.1.1 (right);

EIMPODGreedymbasis.m outputs errors of the EIM-PODâ€”Greedy method for a target function f(x,t)=1/sqrt((x-\mu_1)^2+(t-\mu_2)^1+1) in L_\infty([0,1]^2) with m = 1,...,4 and plots curves in Fig.5.2.1 (left);

EIM_EIMPODGreedy.m outputs errors of the EIM and EIM-POD_Greedy method for f(x,t) in L_\infty([0,1]^2) with m=1 and plots curves in Fig. 5.2.1 (right);

All figures were generated by our custom code in MATLAB R2023a on a laptop with an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor.
